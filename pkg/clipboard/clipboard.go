// Package clipboard describes the cross-machine clipboard: a small manifest,
// kept in the user's own CERNBox home space, naming what was copied and where
// the bytes are.
//
// The manifest is the whole trick. "Copy here, paste there" needs some state
// both machines can see, and the only thing they reliably share is CERNBox
// itself — so the clipboard lives there rather than in a local file, which by
// definition the other machine cannot read.
//
// The format has a package of its own because it is the one part of the feature
// that two machines have to agree on. A slot written by the CLI on lxplus is
// read by whatever version happens to be installed on the laptop, which may be
// older or newer, so the encoding is versioned and every field is optional
// except the ones a reader cannot do without.
