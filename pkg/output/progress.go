// It is deliberately separate from the transfer engine's event stream, because
// the same bar has to be driven two different ways. A download through the engine
// reports its progress as events; a stream joined or handed over by the clipboard
// is a plain io.Copy, with nothing to report anything. Meter accepts both: Add
// for the first, Writer for the second.
//
// Everything about the rendering is a pure function of the meter's state and the
// terminal width, so the layout can be tested without a terminal — which matters,
// because the one thing a progress bar must never do is be wider than the window
// and wrap, turning one line into a screenful of debris.
